# Writing Style: Products of Tomorrow

## The Voice in One Line

Smart friend over coffee — not professor at a podium.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simple language is non-negotiable

Write as if explaining to a sharp person who is not in your field.
If a sentence requires a second read to parse, rewrite it.

- Active voice. "Agents act on your behalf" beats "actions are taken by agents
  on the user's behalf."
- One idea per paragraph. If a paragraph is doing two jobs, split it.
- Concrete over abstract. "A finance app that moves your money without being
  asked" is stronger than "proactive autonomous financial execution."

### 2. Jargon must earn its place — and always be explained

Technical terms are allowed, but only when they add precision that plain English
cannot match. The first time any jargon appears, it gets a plain-English explanation
immediately after — in the same breath, not a footnote.

Format for introducing jargon:
> "Agentic AI — products that act on your behalf without waiting to be asked — ..."

Never assume the reader knows: LLM, multi-agent systems, RAG, context window,
inference, ambient computing, or any other technical term. Treat each one as a
word they're hearing for the first time.

Once a term has been introduced and explained, use it freely.

### 3. Humor belongs in the book — use it deliberately

Humor is not decoration. It is a tool for keeping the reader with you through
conceptually dense material. Use it in these ways:

- **Analogies that make you smile:** "Think less hammer in a toolbox and more
  work buddy who brings donuts and says 'we've got this.'"
- **Absurdist extensions of real ideas:** "Your accounting software might one day
  file its own taxes. Let's hope it doesn't get audited."
- **Self-aware observations:** Name the strangeness of an idea before the reader
  does — it builds trust.
- **Punchy closings on a section:** A well-placed line at the end of a section can
  make the idea stick better than two more paragraphs.

Humor should feel light and natural — never forced, never at the reader's expense.
When in doubt, a dry observation is safer than a joke.

### 4. Real-life analogies are the engine of this book

Every major concept needs a real-world bridge. Readers remember analogies long
after they forget the original explanation. Prioritise analogies from everyday life:

- Cooking ("From buying ingredients to having a private chef who serves dinner")
- Relationships ("Like a mentor who unlocks new levels as you're ready")
- Physical objects ("Less like a hammer in a toolbox, more like a work buddy")
- Familiar services ("Not the menu — the waiter who already knows your order")

Avoid analogies that require domain knowledge. A good analogy works for anyone.

---

### 5. Relate to experiences the reader has lived

Ground abstract ideas in situations the PM reader has personally experienced:

- Frustration at a product that doesn't remember them
- That moment when a product recommendation was eerily accurate
- The feeling of trust breaking when an app does something unexpected with data
- Onboarding flows that ask the same questions every time
- Realizing a product they use daily has become invisible — they just rely on it

When a concept maps to a lived experience, name it. "You've felt this before when..."
is one of the most effective sentences in nonfiction.

## Sentence Rhythm

Good writing has rhythm. This book's rhythm is:

Medium-length setup sentence. Short punchy follow. Then, when needed, a longer
sentence that builds out the idea with a concrete example or named finding so the
reader fully grasps why it matters before moving on. Then short again.

### Short sentences are punctuation, not decoration

A short sentence (under 8 words) after a longer technical passage signals to the
reader: this is the point. Use it to land the conclusion of a paragraph, not to
add another fact.

- After a complex explanation: one short sentence that names what it means.
- After a list of signals or mechanisms: one short sentence that names the pattern.
- After the "so what": one short sentence that makes it portable.

Never stack two short sentences unless the second is a deliberate contrast or
escalation of the first.

> Good: "No single signal was enough. The combination told the story."
> Bad: "No single signal was enough. Each one mattered. Together they worked."
> (three short sentences — the third dilutes the landing of the second)

---

## Sub-Section Titles

Every sub-section title must do one of two things:

**Ask the question the sub-section answers:**
> "What Nest Is Actually Reading"

**Name what is happening in the story — not the category it belongs to:**
> "The Thermostat That Learned to Notice" — not "Products That Read the Room"

A title that could appear in any book on any topic is too generic.
A title that could only appear in this sub-section, in this chapter, is right.

Test: does the title make the reader want to read the first sentence?
If not, rewrite it.

---

## Earn the Mechanism — Tension Before Explanation

Never open a technical explanation without first establishing what problem it
solves or what assumption it challenges. The reader needs to feel the tension
before the resolution lands.

Structure every mechanism explanation in this order:

1. **The failure mode or prior assumption** — one paragraph. Make the reader
   feel why the old approach was broken or incomplete. Do not rush past this.
   If the reader doesn't feel the problem, the solution won't land.
2. **The new approach as the answer** — introduce it as a response to the
   specific failure just described, not as a standalone feature announcement.
3. **The mechanism detail** — now the reader wants to know how it works,
   because they already want it to exist.

> Bad: Open with how Nest fuses three signals.
> Good: Open with the fact that 85–90% of programmable thermostat owners
> never programmed them — then Nest's approach is the answer to a problem
> the reader already feels.

If the mechanism comes first, it reads as a feature list.
If the tension comes first, it reads as a story.

## Formatting Rules

- **No em-dashes (—) used mid-sentence as a structural element.** Use a comma,
  a colon, or a new sentence instead.
- **No bullet-heavy prose.** Bullets are for lists of genuinely parallel items.
  Max 2 bullet lists per section. Everything else is flowing prose.
- **Paragraphs are 3–7 sentences.** 8+ sentence paragraphs get broken up.
- **No stacked single-line sentences.** Three one-liners in a row reads like a
  tweet thread, not a book.
- **Emphasise selectively.** Follow the integrated worker contract and output-formatting §5. Bold existing important claims, comparison phrases or meaningful list lead-ins where they guide the reader. No per-page or per-paragraph quota; never add repetitive preview labels.
- **Section punch lines are bolded** so they are visible on a skim.

---

## What to Avoid

- **Hype language:** "revolutionary," "game-changing," "unprecedented,"
  "transformative" — banned unless immediately backed by a specific named example.
- **Academic hedging:** "It could be argued that," "some might suggest,"
  "in a sense." Take a position.
- **Passive inflation:** Turning "products will act" into "a new mode of acting
  will be observed across the product landscape."
- **Generic examples:** "Imagine a company that uses AI to improve its customer
  experience." Name the company or don't use the example.
- **Overlong setups.** If the interesting part starts in paragraph three,
  cut paragraphs one and two.
- **Category titles for sub-sections.** "Products That Read the Room" tells the
  reader what bucket this is. "The Thermostat That Learned to Notice" tells them
  what happened. Always prefer the latter.

## The Test for Every Paragraph

Ask: would a sharp PM skim this and say "yes, that's new and I can use it"?
If not — either the idea is too vague, the language is too dense, or the
example is too generic. Fix one of those three things.

## The Test for Every Sub-Section Title

Ask: could this title appear in a different book on a different topic?
If yes, it is too generic. Rewrite it until it could only live here.
