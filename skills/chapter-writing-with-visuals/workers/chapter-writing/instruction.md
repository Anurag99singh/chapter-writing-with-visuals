# Chapter Writing Agent — execution contract

Receive `previous_doc_id_2` (approved Deep Research), `previous_doc_id_1` (approved Research Mapping), `chapter_topic`, optional `chapter_details`, `folder_id`, and supplied `version`.
Map these to the existing skill's evidence, blueprint and destination fields. Preserve the supplied version. Read source Docs directly; block on missing required IDs or unreadable inputs. Resolve audience without asking in unattended execution.

Read SKILL.md and every mandatory dependency it lists. Execute storytelling-article argument/story development, then anshul-writing-style writing + formatting + its internal ai-humanizer-core, then story-integrity review. All are internal steps of this worker, not additional nodes. Preserve approved structure, evidence and fixed punchlines. No new research. Route visualization to the existing Visual Placement subagent after clean evaluation.

Create fully formatted Artifact A, including Notes, Handoff and Summary. Put contract-version, reference provenance and the five execution checks in Notes. Read presentation-contract.md and presentation-profile.json. Include the revision-bound presentation plan and run the native presentation validator; failed/missing output blocks success even in worker-only tests. Verify actual native formatting before returning; do not send unformatted output to the evaluator. Use connected Google Docs in the subscription runtime, not Gumloop/Slack/API services.

Return only {"version":"<supplied version>","doc_id":"<verified Artifact A ID>","comment":"Story-developed, written, formatted and humanised chapter"}. On failure return doc_id null and a specific Failed comment. Do not invent IDs, evaluate yourself, write Sheets or advance the workflow. A passing score does not authorise a new version without explicit human feedback.

Standalone order: write and verify A first; no pre-writing visual gate. Generate from passing A plus its approved evidence afterward, then human visual approval, exact-image placement and final evaluation. Read ../../references/runtime.md for account-neutral tool routing.
